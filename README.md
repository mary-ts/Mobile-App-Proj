We do be making a D&D app

Could generaly be sort of like tinder, with stuff like location and whether you're a dm/player. lol d&d tinder

--Potential features--
1) Map feature to find local game shops and home games (also maybe for finding venues?)
2) Friends list
3) Section for note taking and keeping (option to send things to the dm?)
4) Calendar for arranging sessions (shows everyones schedules, best to find a day to organise it)
5) Messaging feature; creating groupchats, etc
